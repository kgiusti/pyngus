# An example script that creates certificates that can be used for
# testing SSL.  Uses the openssl and keytool commands to:
#
# * Create a CA certificate that can be used to verify the peer's
# certificate.
#
# * Create a server certificate signed by the CA, and a private key
# file. The password for the private key file is 'server-password'
#
# * Create a client certificate signed by the CA, and a private key
# file.  The password for the private key file is 'client-password'.
# This certificate can be used for authentication of a client by the
# server.
#
# openssl is provided by the OpenSSL project.
# keytool is provided by the Java JDK

# Create a self-signed certificate for the CA, and a private key to sign certificate requests:

# Create a certificate for the server.  Use the CA's certificate to sign it:
openssl req -out server-request.csr -days 365000 -newkey rsa:2048  -keyout server-private-key.pem -subj "/CN=*.server.com/OU=812" -passout pass:server-password
openssl x509 -req -in server-request.csr -CA ca-certificate.pem -CAkey ca-private-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-certificate.pem -days 365000

# Create a certificate for the client.  Use the CA's certificate to sign it:
openssl req -out client-request.csr -days 365000 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout client-private-key.pem -subj "/CN=my.client.com/OU=812" -passout pass:client-password
